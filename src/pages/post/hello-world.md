Hello everyone! I'm writing my first blog on a [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) file!, cool rite?. This was possible thanks to [Astro Markdown & MDX](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/). Go check them out if you haven't!.
<br/><br/>
I plan to write more blog in the future, I will blog about front-end engineering (React, Node, Javascript, Typescript, etc) and maybe some of my life journal. So stay tune for more content from me!.
<br/><br/>
Alright that will be all from me, I'm signing off 🚶🏽‍♂️.
