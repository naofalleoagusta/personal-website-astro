      <div class="flex flex-wrap">

        I love learning new things, because I enjoyed being fascinated by new
        knowledge, especially technology. Therefore, I'm open to learn new tech
        stack or programming language, for the sake of my employer and science.

        I'm currently based in Palembang, Indonesia ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©, but I've been working
        remotely for several startup in Indonesia. I'm open for remote roles
        across the world.
