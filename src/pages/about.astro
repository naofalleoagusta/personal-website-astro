        I've been lucky enough to work with several tech stack, but I would say
        I'm more prolific to work with these tech stack:

      <div class="flex flex-wrap">
        {
          TECH_STACK.map((dtTechStack) => (

        I love learning new things, because I enjoyed being fascinated by new
        knowledge, especially technology. Therefore, I'm open to learn new tech
        stack or programming language, for the sake of my employer and science.
        At the moment, I'm trying to learn Rust and WASM, because I heard it was <strong

        I'm currently based in Palembang, Indonesia 🇮🇩, but I've been working
        remotely for several startup in Indonesia. I'm open for remote roles
        across the world.

        I used to be a gym rat, till pandemic happen 😭. These days I'd rather
        sit on my chair playing games like Dota 2 or FIFA. Most devs love
        watching anime, but I don't really watch anime that much, I can use my
        fingers to count how many anime I've watched. But I must say, I love
        Attack on Titan, Demons Slayer, and Cyberpunk 2077 Edgerunners. Go check
        them out if you haven't!.

        I would say I'm very passionate about sports, especially Football. I've
        been a Man United fan since God knows when. I also watch Formula 1, NBA
        and American Footbal. For me the best athlete of all time a.k.a The 🐐,
        is Lebron James. I love his dedication to basketball, by the time I'm
        writing this he is about to be 38 years old, and he doesn't show any
        sign of retiring. I'm planning to do the same in term of software
        engineering 😂.
